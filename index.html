	<h3> About Me</h3>
	After working on a goat farm, I turned my herding, milking, and churning skills into a career in web design! Although a tech office is different from a goat milking farm, they  have much in common. THey both operate 24 hours a day; make time for play; rely on culture; allow staff to graze; and turn a simple basic ingredient into luxurious products that people are excited to buy!
	<p> I am also extemely excited about last week tonight with john oliver</p>
